# Changelog

All notable changes to the `orc` plugin are documented here. Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

**Pre-1.0 policy:** breaking changes ship as MINOR bumps (and are called out under **Breaking** below). Post-1.0, breaking changes will require a MAJOR bump.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] — 2026-04-15

### Added
- Seven `/orc:*` slash command wrappers in `plugins/orc/commands/` — `orchestrate`, `backlog`, `status`, `scope`, `recap`, `handoff`, `autoresearch`. Makes orc skills tab-completable as first-class slash commands instead of Skill-tool-only.

### Changed
- **Breaking:** renamed the `plan` skill → `orchestrate` (and its dir `plugins/orc/skills/plan/` → `plugins/orc/skills/orchestrate/`). Invoke as `/orc:orchestrate` instead of `/orc:plan`. Rationale: "plan" collides semantically with Claude-native plan mode (Shift+Tab) and reads as planning rather than multi-agent execution.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-14

### Added
- Initial plugin release, migrated from standalone `fl65inc/orc` repo into the `athan-dial/skills` monorepo.
- Skills: `orchestrate` (then named `plan`), `backlog`, `status`, `scope`, `recap`, `handoff`, `autoresearch`.
- Markdown-table renderers for `backlog` and `status` (replaced prior ANSI/TUI machinery).

### Fixed
- `marketplace.json` schema: `name` no longer contains `/`; `owner` is an object.
- `plugin.json` schema: `author` is an object.

## Bump rules (self-reference)

| Bump | When |
|---|---|
| PATCH | Docs, copy, internal refactors, script fixes, no user-visible behavior change. |
| MINOR | New commands / skills / agents; backwards-compatible capability additions. Pre-1.0: also accepts breaking changes (flagged **Breaking**). |
| MAJOR | Post-1.0 only: removed/renamed user-facing commands, changed input/output contracts, reshaped state files. |

Default to PATCH. Bundle unreleased changes into a single bump rather than bumping per-commit.
